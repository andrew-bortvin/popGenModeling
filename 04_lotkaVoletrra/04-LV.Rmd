## Class 5: Lotka-Volterra I: Competition

To begin with, a simple implementation of the Lotka-Volterra equation in R, with discrete time points: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Initialize conditions
# Population Sizes
N1 <- 30
N2 <- 20

# Carrying Capacities
K1 <- 1000
K2 <- 400

# Interaction parameters between pops
alpha <- 0.1
beta <- 0.9

# Growth rates
r1 <- 1.5
r2 <- 1.3

# Simulation time
nYears <- 20

# Vectors to store population sizes
n1_list <- c(N1)
n2_list <- c(N2)

# Run simulation
for (i in seq(nYears)){
  # Calculate future pop sizes for next time point
  # Saving N1 as a new variable so that it the current value of N1
  # can be used to calculate N2 
  N1_future <- N1 + r1 * N1 * ((K1 - N1 - alpha * N2)/K1) 
  N2_future <- N2 + r2 * N2 * ((K2 - N2 - beta * N1)/K2) 
  
  # Update N1 and N2 
  N1 <- N1_future
  N2 <- N2_future
  
  # Save to list 
  n1_list <- c(n1_list, N1)
  n2_list <- c(n2_list, N2)
}

# Convert to data frame
df <- data.frame(
  time = seq(length(n1_list)),
  n1 = n1_list,
  n2 = n2_list
)

# Convert to tall format
df <- melt(df, id.vars = "time")
colnames(df) <- c("time", "pop", "size")
  
# Plot
ggplot(df, aes(x = time,
               y = size, 
               color = pop)) +
  geom_line() + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(x = "Time (Generations)", 
       y = "Population Size",
       color = "Population") + 
  theme_bw()
```

A couple things are apparent from this mode: 

* Under these conditions, both populations are not able to coexist - after a brief period of growth, population 2 collapses to 0. 
* In this model, population 2 dips below 0 at generation 6. 

The first behavior is fine - it's a pretty basic property of this model that many parameter combinations lead to one population outcompeting the other to extinction. This is called **competitive exclusion**.

The second behavior - dipping below zero - is not desirable. While our models are theoretical representations of reality, unrealistic behaviors like this are good to correct. 

Here, shooting below zero happens because with a large step size and a large growth rate, our model moves too quickly. In response to this, we can decrease our step size. In fact, if we decrease our step size enough, our model very closely approximates the continuous form of the equation. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Initialize conditions
# Population Sizes
N1 <- 30
N2 <- 20

# Carrying Capacities
K1 <- 1000
K2 <- 400

# Interaction parameters between pops
alpha <- 0.1
beta <- 0.9

# Growth rates
r1 <- 1.5
r2 <- 1.3

# Simulation time
nYears <- 20

# Vectors to store population sizes
n1_list <- c(N1)
n2_list <- c(N2)

# Create a step size
stepSize <- 0.01

# Run simulation
for (i in seq(nYears/stepSize)){   # Scale our for loop range by the step size
  # Calculate future pop sizes for next time point
  # Saving N1 as a new variable so that it the current value of N1
  # can be used to calculate N2 
  N1_future <- N1 + r1 * N1 * ((K1 - N1 - alpha * N2)/K1) * stepSize # Multiply by step size
  N2_future <- N2 + r2 * N2 * ((K2 - N2 - beta * N1)/K2)  * stepSize # Multiply by step size
  
  # Update N1 and N2 
  N1 <- N1_future
  N2 <- N2_future
  
  # Save to list 
  n1_list <- c(n1_list, N1)
  n2_list <- c(n2_list, N2)
}

# Convert to data frame
df <- data.frame(
  time = seq(length(n1_list)),
  n1 = n1_list,
  n2 = n2_list
)

# Convert to tall format
df <- melt(df, id.vars = "time")
colnames(df) <- c("time", "pop", "size")
  
# Plot
ggplot(df, aes(x = time * stepSize, # We multiply time by stepSize to convert back to years
               y = size, 
               color = pop)) +
  geom_line() + 
  labs(x = "Time (Generations)", 
       y = "Population Size",
       color = "Population") + 
  theme_bw()
```

A few changes are needed to make this work: 

* The for loop is changed to incorporate step size: `for (i in seq(nYears/stepSize))`. If, previously, each step represented one generation, each step now represents one generation * stepSize - just a fraction of the time. In other words, we need to run our model more times to represent an equal amount of real time.
* When calculating population sizes, we incorporate step size: `N1_future <- N1 + r1 * N1 * ((K1 - N1 - alpha * N2)/K1) * stepSize`
* Lastly, when plotting, we convert time back to years by multiplying by stepSize again: `ggplot(df, aes(x = time * stepSize,`

So far, we have seen models where one population outcompetes the other. It is worth noting that this is not an inherent property of Lotka-Volterra models: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Initialize conditions
# Population Sizes
N1 <- 30
N2 <- 20

# Carrying Capacities
K1 <- 1000
K2 <- 1000

alpha <- 0.4
beta <- 0.9

# Growth rates
r1 <- 1.5
r2 <- 1.3

# Simulation time
nYears <- 20

# Vectors to store population sizes
n1_list <- c(N1)
n2_list <- c(N2)

# Create a step size
stepSize <- 0.01

# Run simulation
for (i in seq(nYears/stepSize)){ # Scale our for loop range by the step size
  # Calculate future pop sizes for next time point
  # Saving N1 as a new variable so that it the current value of N1
  # can be used to calculate N2 
  N1_future <- N1 + r1 * N1 * ((K1 - N1 - alpha * N2)/K1) * stepSize # Multiply by step size
  N2_future <- N2 + r2 * N2 * ((K2 - N2 - beta * N1)/K2) * stepSize # Multiply by step size
   
  # Update N1 and N2
  N1 <- N1_future
  N2 <- N2_future
  
  # Save to list 
  n1_list <- c(n1_list, N1)
  n2_list <- c(n2_list, N2)
}

# Convert to data frame
df <- data.frame(
  time = seq(length(n1_list)),
  n1 = n1_list,
  n2 = n2_list
)

# Convert to tall format
df <- melt(df, id.vars = "time")
colnames(df) <- c("time", "pop", "size")
  
# Plot
ggplot(df, aes(x = time / stepSize, # We multiply time by stepSize to convert back to years
               y = size, 
               color = pop)) +
  geom_line() + 
  labs(x = "Time (Generations)", 
       y = "Population Size",
       color = "Population") + 
  theme_bw()
