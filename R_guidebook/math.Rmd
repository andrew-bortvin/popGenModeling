```{r, include = FALSE}

```

## Math 

A lot of mathematical operations in R are straightforward. Here are some of the basic operations we can perform:

• + and -: addition and subtraction \
• * and /: multiplication and division \
• **: exponentials \

We can perform mathematical operations on values directly: \

```{r}
print(2 + 3)
```

Or we can operate on variables:

```{r}
x <- 5 
print(5**3)
```

We can save the output of an expression as a variable:

```{r}
my_product <- 2 * 10
print(my_product)
```

### Order of Operations

R follows the usual mathematical order of operations. And like in math, we can use parentheses `()` to enforce a specific order.

```{r}
print(2 * (2 + 2))
```
