## Plotting

The base R programming language comes with some pretty robust tools for plotting. However, most R users instead use the external library `ggplot2`, which simplifies plotting and allows for more elaborate data visualization. 

Your Posit cloud accounts have `ggplot2` pre-installed. However, at the start of each script where you plot, you must let R know that you will use an external package with the line:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

For a simple dataset to plot, Iâ€™ve saved the temperature in Fahrenheit in Baltimore, MD and Wommels, Netherlands for the next seven hours:

```{r}
temperatures = data.frame(
  hours = seq(1,7),
  tempBaltimore = c(74, 73, 72, 71, 75, 79, 87),
  tempWommels = c(59, 60, 62, 65, 69, 72, 67)
)

head(temperatures)
```
