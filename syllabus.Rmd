# Course Syllabus

**COMPUTATIONAL APPROACHES TO POPULATION GENETICS** Instructor: Andrew Bortvin Times: Tuesday, Thursday 3:00PM - 4:30PM Office Hours: To be determined by when2meet at the start of the semester, or by appointment Course website: <https://andrew-bortvin.github.io/popGenModeling/>

### **Course Description**

The size, composition, and genetics of populations fluctuate over time. These fluctuations are the product of dynamics between individuals, the interactions between populations, and the context of a population within a broader ecological landscape. The quantitative tools developed to study population genetics allow biologists to discover the simple fundamental principles that govern these complex systems. This course will introduce the basic theory of population genetics while teaching students the fundamental skills of programming in the R programming language, which will allow them to directly implement and visualize theoretical concepts. Students will model and simulate theoretical populations and analyze population-scale genomic data. This course will examine evolution on a variety of scales, ranging from the competition between cells within a single organism, to population dynamics in conservation biology that span decades, to the evolution of contemporary human populations over hundreds of thousands of years.

### **Learning Goals**

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

• outline, using biology theory and terms, how populations grow and interact with each other • describe the external factors that can cause changes in genetic diversity and use this information to predict how specific demographic scenarios would impact a population • manipulate, analyze, and visualize data using R programming • describe and interpret common formats used to store genomic data, and implement standard analytic protocols used to analyze these data types

### **Grading**

30% Participation 40% Weekly Assignments 30% Final Project

\*\*Weekly Assignments

Class sessions will consist of a lecture in which theory is introduced, instructor-led live-coding sessions that implement the models studied in class, and time for students to work independently on assignments that further develop the models designed in class. There will be one assignment per week, assigned each Thursday and due the following Thursday. After submission, students will receive feedback from the instructor on each assignment and will have until the end of the semester to submit any revisions necessary.

Each assignment will consist of a set of required exercises that can be completed by students of any coding background. These will be followed by optional, more computationally-focused exercises, which will allow students to leverage their computational knowledge in creative application to genomic questions.

Work will be graded on reasonable completion--that is to say, code that demonstrates an understanding of an algorithm and its general implementation will receive full marks, regardless of whether output is exactly correct. Students will also be assessed on the clarity and interpretability of the data visualizations that their code outputs and the accuracy of their responses to short questions prompting biological interpretation of their results.

**Googling and AI**

Googling is always an acceptable way to find answers or help, and I encourage you to utilize it extensively. If you adopt a solution following a Google search, make sure you understand what you incorporate, rather than just copy/paste without comprehension of the logic or code. Google is also a good way to learn more about any error messages you encounter in your code.

You may be familiar with ChatGPT and other large language models. After trying each problem/assignment/task on your own, if you're still running into issues, feel free to use ChatGPT as you would any other online resource (Google, stack overflow, etc.). Learning how to succinctly describe exactly what you want to accomplish is a skillset in itself, so this can be good practice. If you find code that seems to work (e.g., from Google) but you're not sure how exactly it works, you can also type it into ChatGPT and ask it to explain what's happening. As always, please do not submit any code if you are not familiar entirely with how it works; flag it and ask an instructor for assistance. Be aware that ChatGPT might confidently offer an answer that is not correct; so always check the output on your own.
