## Lecture Notes 

In this module, we will learn the basics of R by manipulating some real-world data. In particular, we'll work with data from the Hudson Bay looking at the size of historical hare and lynx populations.

We'll talk a lot more about this dataset and the biology it represents when we study predator-prey models, but for now let's use it make some exploratory plots.

Data adapted from here: <http://people.whitman.edu/~hundledr/courses/M250F03/M250.html>

### Data import

Our data is available as a comma-delimited text file, or `csv`. Here's the top of it as it appears in a text editor:

The first thing we have to do to work with it is to import it into R. R has a few built-in functions that allow for easy and efficient import of data. As we go on, we'll learn a lot of nuances about how these work, but for now we'll start with a tidy, well-behaved dataset that is easy to work with. The `read.table` function will be our workhorse for reading in data.

Let's try it out. To run this function, we need to provide one **argument**: the location of the data we want to load.

```{r}
read.table("hare_lynx.csv")
```

A couple things went wrong here:

1.  The data is imported as a single column - we want R to know that there are multiple columns delimited by commas
2.  The header (`Year,Species,Count`) was imported as the first row of our data - we would instead like R to recognize that this is a header rather than a row of data

How do we fix this? Along with the essential argument of the file location, we can provide `read.table` with many **optional arguments**. Because there are many possibilities for what our second argument may be, we need to explicitly reference the name of our optional arguments.

Let's inform R that our data is split by commas. We can do this using the `sep` (short for "separator") argument.

```{r}
read.table("hare_lynx.csv", sep = ",")
```

Now we correctly have three columns of data! We now have to tell R that the first row is a header. There is an optional argument `header` which can be set to `TRUE` or `FALSE` (case sensitive - more on this later).

```{r}
read.table("hare_lynx.csv", sep = ",", header = TRUE)
```

Looks good! Now, a couple nuances:

1.  The order **named arguments** (here, `sep` and `header` doesn't matter. The following lines of code are equivalent:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
read.table("hare_lynx.csv", sep = ",", header = TRUE)
read.table("hare_lynx.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")
```

2.  For better legibility, we can add line breaks after commas, like so:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
read.table("hare_lynx.csv", 
           sep = ",", 
           header = TRUE)
```

This does not impact how data is evaluated.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

```
