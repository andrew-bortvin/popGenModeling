## Class 3: Exponential Growth and Age Structure

Today, we're looking at the exponential growth model, which describes how a population grows in the absence of density dependence - that is, when the growth rate doesn't change in response to population size. First, we'll plot exponential growth for one population at a given per capita growth rate. 

```{r}
# Initialize parameters  
N <- 50                    # Population Size
r <- 0.04                  # Per capita growth rate
lambda <- 1 + r
n_generations <- 50

# Vector to keep track of population size
popSize <- c(N)

# Run simulation
for (i in seq(n_generations)){
  N <- N * lambda                    # Calculate next generation
  popSize <- c(popSize, N)
}

# Organize into data frame
df <- data.frame(
  generation = seq(0, n_generations),
  popSize = popSize
)

# Plot 
ggplot(df, aes(x = generation, 
               y = popSize)) +
  geom_point() +
  xlab("Generation") + 
  ylab("Population Size") +
  ggtitle("Exponential Growth") +
  theme_bw()
```

Next, plotting across multiple growth rates:

```{r}
# Initialize parameters
n_generations <- 50

# Vectors to track variable
generations <- c()
popSizeList <- c()
growthRate <- c()     # Tracking growth rate so that we can separate our data by rate when plotting

# Run simulation
for (growth_rate in c(-0.1, 0, 0.02, 0.04)){  # Loop through all the growth rates (i.e. run simulation once for each rate)
  lambda <- 1 + growth_rate  # Get lambda for the current growth rate
  N <- 50                    # Reset starting population size to 50
  popSize <- c(N)             # Track population size for current run of the simulation
  
  # Run simulation for 50 generations
  for (i in seq(n_generations)){
    N <- N * lambda
    popSize <- c(popSize, N)
  }
  
  # Update vectors with simulation output
  generations <- c(generations, seq(0, n_generations))
  popSizeList <- c(popSizeList, popSize)
  growthRate <- c(growthRate, rep(lambda, n_generations + 1))
}

# Reorganize into a data frame 
df <- data.frame(
  generations = generations,
  popSize = popSizeList,
  growthRate = growthRate
)

# Plot
ggplot(df, aes(x = generations, 
               y = popSize, 
               color = factor(growthRate))) +
    geom_point() +
  xlab("Generation") + 
  ylab("Population Size") +
  ggtitle("Exponential Growth") +
  theme_bw() + 
  labs(color = "Growth Rate")   # Change label of the color legend
```

Notice that our population decreases when lambda < 1, stays constant when lambda = 1, and increases when lambda > 1.

### Comparison to Real Data

I've pulled some data from Yoav et al. 2019, PNAS (https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1902217116). This data set tracks microbial growth across a series of plates. Reading in the data:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
yoavData <- read.csv("yoavData.csv", row.names = "X")
head(yoavData)
```

```{r importData, echo=FALSE}
yoavData <- read.csv("yoavData.csv", row.names = "X")
head(yoavData)
```


The data has three columns: `Time.S` - the time in seconds, `Plate` - the name of the plate that the culture is grown in, and `Size` - the size of the colony. First, plotting the size of the colony for the first 13,000 seconds:

```{r}
ggplot(yoavData, aes(x = Time.S, y = Size, color = Plate)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  xlim(c(0, 13000)) +
  ylim(c(0, 300000))
```

Visually, this looks exponential. We can fit a curve to it. To do this, we can use the function `lm()` which fits a linear model. The tilde (`~`) symbol indicates the relationship we want to measure - in other words, this equation measures `log(Size)` as a function of `Time`. To make this an exponential fit, we take the log of the dependent variable:

```{r}
fitData <- yoavData[yoavData$Time.S < 15000, ]
lm(log(fitData$Size) ~ fitData$Time.S)
```
We can plot this along the real-world data. 

```{r, warnings = FALSE}
# Creating a dataframe from our function
xs <- seq(1, 60000)                        # Set the x values we want to evaluate
ys <- exp(10.067264) * exp(0.000182 * xs)  # Get the corresponding values using coefficients from the fit
fit_line <-data.frame(Time.S = xs,         # Convert to data frame
                      Size = ys,
                      Plate = "fit")

# Notice that the names we give above
# Match the names of the axes of our plotting data.

# We also give create a column "Plate" for color-coding

# Plot data
ggplot(yoavData, aes(x = Time.S, y = Size, color = Plate)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  geom_line(data = fit_line, size = 1, color = "black") + # Plot the line of best fit 
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  xlim(c(0, 13000)) +
  ylim(c(0, 300000)) 
```

Notice that when we add the line of best fit, we provide the argument `data = fit_line`. This tells `ggplot` that we are using a second data set not provided in the initial `ggplot` call. 

Now, let's plot our data extending further in time - this is done by changing the `xlim` arguments:

```{r, warnings=FALSE}
xs <- seq(1, 60000)
ys <- exp(10.067264) * exp(0.000182 * xs)
fit_line <-data.frame(Time.S = xs,
                      Size = ys,
                      Plate = "fit")


ggplot(yoavData, aes(x = Time.S, y = Size, color = Plate)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  geom_line(data = fit_line, size = 1, color = "black") +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  xlim(c(0, 35000)) +       # Changed x limits to see further into the Time 
  ylim(c(0, 800000)) 
```

Notice that as the population grows, the exponential model is an increasingly poor fit - the exponential model predicts continued growth at an increasing rate; the actual data shows growth slowing down until the population hits a plateau. We'll look at this discrepancy in more detail next class! 

### Age Structure

Next, let's look at age structured populations - that is a population where we track the ages of individuals and where individuals of different ages can have different reproduction rates and mortalities. 

We'll start with a simplified population of 0 and 1-year olds. In each generation, the number of 1 year olds in the next generation is determined purely by the number of 0 years olds that survive the year, and the number of 0 year olds is determined by the sum of the number 0 year olds and the number of 1 year olds that reproduce. 

```{r , eval=FALSE}
# Initializing parameters
# Initial numbers of 0 and 1 year olds
N0 <- 2  
N1 <- 10

# Birth Rates for 0 and 1 year olds
f0 <- 0.4
f1 <- 1.8

# Death Rates 
# Just for 0 year olds - all 1 year olds die
S0 <- 0.7 

n_generations <- 50

# Empty vectors to store data 
n0_list <- c()
n1_list <- c()

# Run simulation
for (i in seq(n_generations)){
  # Calculate  the number of 0 and 1 year olds in the next generation 
  N0_next_gneration <- N0 * f0 + N1 *f1
  N1_next_generation <- N0 * S0
  
  # Update values 
  N0 <- N0_next_gneration
  N1 <- N1_next_generation
  
  # Add to lists
  n0_list <- c(n0_list, N0)
  n1_list <- c(n1_list, N1)
  
}

# Organize into data frame
df <- data.frame(
  n0 = n0_list,
  n1 = n1_list,
  generation = seq(n_generations)
)

# Convert to tall format
df <- melt(df, id.vars = "generation")
colnames(df) <- c("Generation", "Age", "PopulationSize")

# Plot
ggplot(df, aes(x = Generation, y = PopulationSize, color = Age)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_line() +  
  theme_classic() +
  ylab("Population Size") 
```

![](02-exponential_growth/img/age_struct_1.png)

This looks like normal exponential growth, with slightly different rates for 0 and 1 year olds. However, let's zoom in on early time points: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(df, aes(x = Generation, y = PopulationSize, color = Age)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_line() +  
  theme_classic() +
  ylab("Population Size") +
  xlim(c(0, 10)) + 
  ylim(c(0,400))
```

![](02-exponential_growth/img/age_struct_2.png)

The last thing we want to do with this data is plot the ratio of 0 to 1 year olds: 

```{r}
# Initializing parameters
# Initial numbers of 0 and 1 year olds
N0 <- 2  
N1 <- 10

# Birth Rates for 0 and 1 year olds
f0 <- 0.4
f1 <- 1.8

# Death Rates 
# Just for 0 year olds - all 1 year olds die
S0 <- 0.7 

n_generations <- 50

# Empty vectors to store data 
ratio_list <- c(N0/N1)

# Run simulation
for (i in seq(n_generations)){
  # Calculate  the number of 0 and 1 year olds in the next generation 
  N0_next_gneration <- N0 * f0 + N1 *f1
  N1_next_generation <- N0 * S0
  
  # Update values 
  N0 <- N0_next_gneration
  N1 <- N1_next_generation
  
  # Add to list
  ratio_list <- c(ratio_list, N0/N1)  # Calculate the ratio of 0/1 year olds
}

# Organize into a data frame
ratioDf <- data.frame(
  generations = seq(0, n_generations),
  ratio = ratio_list
)

# Plot
ggplot(ratioDf, aes(x = generations, 
                    y = ratio)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  theme_bw() + 
  xlab("Generation") + 
  ylab("Ratio 0:1 Year Olds")
```


Notice that after an initial period of chaos, the ratio of age groups stabilizes. This is called the stable age distribution and is a general property of age structured models like this. 

### The Leslie Matrix

The Leslie matrix allows us to very efficiently extend age structured models to an arbitrarily large number of populations. 

In the Leslie matrix `L`, the first row is the fecundity of each category, and the area beneath that has a diagonal arrangement of survival rates for each age category. 

Note that for matrix multiplication, we use `%*%`.

```{r}
# Leslie matrix
L <- matrix(data = c(0, 0, 0.1, 1.1, 1.8, 0.9, 0.4, 0.1,
                     0.4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
                     0, 0.9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
                     0, 0, 0.8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
                     0, 0, 0, 0.9, 0, 0, 0, 0,
                     0, 0, 0, 0, 0.8, 0, 0, 0,
                     0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.2, 0, 0,
                     0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.1, 0), nrow = 8, ncol = 8, byrow = TRUE)

# Starting population size for each age class
pop_matrix <- as.matrix(c(1, 3, 2, 0, 6, 10, 25, 15))

# Starting population size for each age class
total_size <- c(sum(pop_matrix))

n_generations <- 40

# Run simulation 
for (i in seq(n_generations)){
  pop_matrix <- L %*% pop_matrix
  total_size <- c(total_size, sum(pop_matrix))
}

# Organize data into a data frame
df <- data.frame(
  year = seq(0, n_generations),
  size = total_size
)

# Plot
ggplot(df, aes(x=year, y = size)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_line() + 
  theme_bw() +
  xlab("Time (Year)") +
  ylab("Population Size")
```
